ðŸ‘‹ **Hi there!** 

My name is Kim Denis and I'm currently working as a Data Analyst. My passion for Data, Analysis, coding, Machine Learning and AI is what drives me to strive for a career as a Data Scientist. I have honed my skills in SQL, Python, and R. Always eager to learn and work on exciting projects that challenge me. As I navigate through my career, I hope to make a positive impact through my work and contributions to the field of Data.

I am open to new opportunities and I am confident that together, we can create something amazing. Whether you're a fellow data enthusiast or someone with a unique perspective to offer, I believe that collaboration is key to growth and success. So, if you're interested in working together on a project or simply exchanging ideas, don't hesitate to reach out to me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimdenis98/).
